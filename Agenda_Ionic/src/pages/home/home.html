      In my holidays, I went to my grandparent´s house, in Argentina (no se de donde eres, aquí pon lo que se te ocurra) with my parents and my brothers. I swam in their swimming pool, and I played football with my cousins. It was very funny.

When I came back, I went to the cinema with some friends. We saw "Terminator" (o cualquier película), it was great! We ate pop corn and then we went to a cyber. We had an exellent day.

The rest of the week I played on the computer, the playstation, and I saw television. I enjoyed a lot my holidays. I want to repeat it in my next holidays.
